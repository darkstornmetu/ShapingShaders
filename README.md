# ShapingShaders

Shaping Shaders is a Unity shader collection showcasing various shape manipulations through Shader Graph and HLSL.

* The collection includes a range of geometric transformations and visual effects, from simple shapes like circles and squares to more dynamic patterns and distortions.
* One shader is coded using HLSL for more customized control, while the rest are created with Shader Graph for a visual, node-based workflow.

What can be learned:

* Basics of Shader Graph, including shape manipulation and color transitions.
* Introduction to HLSL for more detailed control over shader behavior.
* Custom functions inside shader graph
* How to experiment with geometric transformations and procedural patterns.

**Note:** These shaders were inspired by Nik Lever's course on Unity shaders written in Cg. While my shaders are implemented in Shader Graph and HLSL, they build upon the foundational concepts and techniques covered in his lessons.
